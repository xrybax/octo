//! Lyrics, the pure parts: the models, LRC reading and writing, the rule for which entry is the
//! song, the Lyricsfile reader, what a song file has now, the pin model, and the library job's
//! run and the lyrics page's rules. The sources, the service, the sidecar writer and the pin
//! store live in `octo` under `octo::services::lyrics`.
//!
//! **Text positions.** A word is placed in its line by UTF-8 byte offsets into `LyricLine::text`,
//! so a word is `&text[from..to]` and the OpenSubsonic cues (UTF-8 byte offsets) need no
//! conversion. The positions are never written anywhere.
