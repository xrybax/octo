//! The family gate: one layer every request passes while Family is on. It works out who is
//! asking, signs members in to Navidrome with their hidden passwords, and puts a
//! [`FamilyCaller`] on the request for the handlers and the family rules. With Family off it
//! hands every request on untouched before looking at anything.
//!
//! - **One reading**: the gate reads each request once, query and body, and puts what it read
//!   on the request as a [`GateReading`]: the parameters every handler reads, which sign-in
//!   keys were there, and who it is from. A `/rest` body it cannot read (a multipart form with
//!   no usable boundary, JSON that is not one object) is refused with Subsonic error 0. Anyone
//!   outside the family, the owner included, is checked only through that reading: Navidrome is
//!   asked about exactly the sign-in the gate read (a cached ping), and only then is their
//!   device noted.
//! - **Subsonic (`/rest`)**: a request whose `u` names a member is checked against the
//!   member's one account password (`p`, plain or `enc:` hex, or `t` with `s`, or a browser
//!   token Octo signed for a web player session) and rewritten, in the query and in a url-encoded or JSON body, to `u` with a
//!   fresh `s` and `t` made from the hidden password. An API key or a `jwt` that turns out to be
//!   a member's is rewritten the same way. A wrong sign-in is answered with Subsonic error 40
//!   and never reaches Navidrome; twenty wrong ones from one address for one member in 15
//!   minutes, or a hundred from the peer that connected, or a hundred for the member from
//!   addresses that never signed in as them, and the rest are refused unchecked. Addresses that
//!   did sign in as the member count their wrong tries apart (a hundred more together), so a
//!   flood from strangers never locks out an app that already has the password. The owner and
//!   anyone outside the family pass through exactly as they came. A member's device is recorded
//!   only once its sign-in checked out.
//! - **Paths**: a request is judged by its path as Navidrome may end up reading it
//!   ([`gate_path`]), so `/rest/%67etNowPlaying`, `/rest/x/../getNowPlaying` and the like meet
//!   the rules of the endpoint they reach.
//! - **Navidrome's web player**: a member signs in on `/auth/login` with their account
//!   password. Octo signs in to Navidrome for them and answers with a token of its
//!   own; the real one stays on the member's web device and is swapped in on the way to
//!   Navidrome, and every fresh one Navidrome hands back is swapped for a fresh Octo token.
//! - **Radio streams** name their listener through the stream's session.
//! - **Audio**: every request that hands out audio, a radio stream included, passes the audio
//!   gate ([`audio_gate`]), which may refuse it, sets its quality and tracks its body.
//!
//! When Navidrome refuses a member's rewritten sign-in (someone changed the password there),
//! the gate sets a new hidden password once and tries again.
