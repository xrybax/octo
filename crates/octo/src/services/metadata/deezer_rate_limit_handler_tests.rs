//! Tests of the Deezer rate limit handler. The Deezer service tests build the service over a
//! mock server whose host is not the API's, so they run WITHOUT the metering. These drive the
//! handler directly, because the traps here are all silent: a wrongly-metered CDN, a lane that
//! steals another lane's budget, or a rejection that never surfaces.
//!
//! The mock server stands in for every host: requests to `127.0.0.1` are the API (the handler
//! is told that is the API host), and requests to `localhost`, the same server under another
//! name, are the CDN and unrelated hosts.
