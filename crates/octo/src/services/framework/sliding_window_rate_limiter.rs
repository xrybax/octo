//! A sliding-window rate limiter, as the Deezer and AcoustID limiters configure it: the oldest
//! queued request is served first, permits come back on their own, and each request takes one
//! permit.
//!
//! The window is cut into segments. A permit taken during a segment comes back when the window
//! has slid all the way round to that segment again, so a burst spends the budget and it
//! returns a segment at a time, not when a lease is disposed (leases carry nothing back). A
//! request that finds no permit waits in a bounded first-in-first-out queue; when the queue is
//! full it gets a lease that was not acquired, at once.
//!
//! The window moves lazily: every acquire first replays the segment boundaries that have passed
//! since the limiter was built (on the tokio clock, so `tokio::time::pause` drives it in tests),
//! and a queued request sleeps until the next boundary and replays it. The boundaries fall where
//! a periodic timer would have fired them.
